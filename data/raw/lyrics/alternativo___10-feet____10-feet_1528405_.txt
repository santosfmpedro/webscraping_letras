["I don't know since when I changed to such a cold-hearted guy", 'I have to warm this frozen icy lonely heart to thaw', 'I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure', "I'm gonna make my coming days to be filled with laughter and joy", '\n', "I let myself down that I'm more cruel than I thought I would be", "I'm just a loser who ends up by caring for my soul", "I don't give my heart to no one cause i don't wanna waste my time", 'I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of this lonesome hole', '\n', "Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations", 'Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions', "Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once", 'Love is not the word only for the sweet romance', '\n', "Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death", "And I'm scared to keep on going on my way", "Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death", "And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end", '\n', 'Recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days', 'And all the memories I wanted to forget for making leaps', 'Recalling, aching, breaking, crying, making sure to me', 'And I take all and grin at my future on the way', '\n']
